## General Information
The Habit Tracker is a web application that allows you to track habits while leveling up a pet. From the Home page you can sign up or login. Once you have signed up or logged in you will be able to go to your Dashboard and add/remove habits. As you complete the habits before or on the day they are scheduled to be completed, your pet will gain experience points and level up. There is an about page that talks about the psychology of building habits along with tips on forming good habits and breaking bad habits. Psychology shows that using a reward as a motivation to complete a habit, such as leveling up and evolving your own pet can keep you motivated and more likely to succeed.
